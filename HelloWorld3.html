<h2>This is my third page and I'm brainstorming about the ways to make this more exciting.</h2><br><br>

I have some that I have already started writing and I sat with some family members for some fun stories.<br><br>
<h1><b><p align="center">NOSTALGIA</p></b></h1>
Isn't if funny that we live so many moments but don't feel a sense of nostalgia more often? 
You would think that the more you live, the more often you would feel them. Is it a loss of memory, a defense mechanism or are we just too busy to notice the small things that trigger the memories? I supposed it is probably a combination of things. I definitely have a pretty bad memory problem so that it why I'm writing this all down. It may not all make sense and pieces still may not fit together but, I'm going to try.
